# Task-04: Image-to-Image Translation with cGAN (pix2pix)

This project implements a pix2pix model using Conditional GAN (cGAN) for image-to-image translation tasks (e.g., edges to photo).

## Requirements
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
The project uses the `edges2shoes` dataset from the official pix2pix resources.

## How to Run
1. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run training: `python train_pix2pix.py`
